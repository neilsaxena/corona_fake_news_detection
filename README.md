# Corona fake news detection
→ In this project, Machine learning as well as deep learning technique is been used to identify that a given news is a fake news or not.

→ We have trained our model on machine learning techniques like Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine and deep learning techniques like LSTM and Bi-directional LSTM.

→ We have created a flask app and used our models in it.

## Dataset
→ We have created corona fake news data manually. The dataset contains two column namely the "news" column and the "label" column. It contains around 1800 rows.

## Installation
→ In the command prompt first go to the directory in which requirements.txt file is present and then install all the required libraries using below command
```
pip  install  -r  requirements.txt
```

## Training
→ In the command prompt navigate into the directory of the required algorithm and then run the main.py file using python. For example use following command:
```
python  main.py
```
the model will be trained and saved in that directory itself.

## Usage
→ In the command prompt navigate into the directory of the required algorithm and then run the app.py file using python. For example use following command:
```
python  app.py
```
